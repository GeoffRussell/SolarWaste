This project is a R Shiny dashboard that calculates the tonnage of waste
associated with a global solar PV panel rollout. 

The model is parameterised allowing you to change:

1. Growth rate from 2022 to 2030
2. Growth rate from 2031 to 2050
3. Tonnage of material per gigawatt (GW) of panels
4. Panel average lifespan
5. Recycling capacity in 2022 
6. Recycling growth rate
