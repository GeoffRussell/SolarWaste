## Model assumptions 

The top graph, with its initial slider settings, 
models a World rollout of solar PV panels roughly similar to the IEA Net Zero by 2050. You can also
look at some individual countries to see how they are travelling with the same growth rate assumptions.

This IEA plan proposes some 18,750 GW of solar PV ([as updated in 2023](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/9a698da4-4002-4e53-8ef3-631d8971bf84/NetZeroRoadmap_AGlobalPathwaytoKeepthe1.5CGoalinReach-2023Update.pdf)).
As you can see, the model illustrated in the graph above, yields a similar operational level of 
GW by 2050. The 
small difference is down an incomplete specification of compound growth rates in the plan
and some minor variations in initial conditions; the number of GW of solar rolled out between 2005 and 2022. 
I've use the [Statstical Review of World Energy 2023](https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review) (which used to be published by BP) for historical PV capacity; which is a little different from the IEA data.

The initial settings roughly mirror the assumptions in the IEA netzero by 2050 plan.
This plan specifies a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23% out to 2030, but with some
levelling off so that CAGR between now and 2050 will average 11%. The 
trajectory of the growth rate curve isn't specified precisely. For the
moment I model two consecutive periods with fixed CAGR in each period.

You can also request a prediction of how based on the data between 2005 and 2022. This is just
a statistical prediction, it is entirely ignorant of policy settings that may or may not influence the
future. 

**PV panel failure**

The failure model used merely takes panels out of the installed base according to a fairly standard industrial
model based on the mean time to failure of panels (ie. average panel lifespan).

The initial value of this lifespan parameter is 30 years. 

The timing of panel failure is determined by the PV panel failure slider. 
The IRENA [2016 report](https://www.irena.org/publications/2016/Jun/End-of-life-management-Solar-Photovoltaic-Panels) 
on PV end-of-life management considered two scenarios, *Early loss* (corresponding to value 2.4 on the slider) and
*Regular loss* (corresponding to 5.4 on the slider). These numbers change the timing of waste generation, but not the
long term amount; all panels end up as waste. The early loss scenario corresponds to many panels failing quickly with the rate
of failure than slowing substantially. Our initial value of 1 sees many panels fail quickly but the rate then slows substantially with many panels having a long life. 

My model is consistent with the IRENA model, except that they envisage only about 4,500 GW of PV by 2050.
