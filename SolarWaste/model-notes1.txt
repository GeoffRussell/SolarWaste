**PV recycling**

Recycling is modelled by magic whereby failed panels are simply added back to the
operational base until the recycling capacity for the year is reached. We allow the recycling capacity and its growth
rate to be changed; like all the other model parameters.

A more realistic model would dial back the production growth rate as the recycling rate increased. This would keep
the installed base tracking the IEA planning target.

I don't really have any idea how much PV recycling is being done at present. I see media report of small or very small
projects. So my guess at 10 GW per year would amount to about 30 million panels a year. 

**Panel weight and waste**

The initial setting of 70,000 tonnes of mined materials per GW or 
PV panels is based on reading a stack of specification sheets. Panels used in solar farms are typically heavier than
those used on rooftops. Over time, weight of panels has declined per MW. Has this been at the expense of durability? Given that solar farms use heavier panels, the answer would appear to be yes.  

No account is made of the aluminium, steel and possibly concrete used for
mounting panels, either on rooftops or in utility scale farms. The weight
of mounting materials often exceeds that of the panels themselves. For
utility scale farms, the soil and weather will determine if concrete
footings are required; the tendency seems, for obvious reasons, to try
and avoid that expense.

### Guide to the graph 

All the bars on the chart are in gigawatts (GW). The calculated tonnage of waste below the graph is just estimated
by multiplying the GW by the tonnage per factor figure in the slider.

The bars are as follows:

1. cumFailed ... these are panels which have failed but haven't been recycled because of a lack of capacity 
1. cumInstalled ... total GW included failed panels  
1. operational ... cuminstalled - cumfailed + recycled
1. produced ... new production from freshly mined materials 
1. recycled ... production from recycled material; assumed to be perfect
