## PV recycling in the model

Recycling is modelled by magic whereby failed panels are simply added back to the
operational base until the recycling capacity for the year is reached. We allow the recycling capacity and its growth
rate to be changed; like all the other model parameters.

A more realistic model would dial back the production growth rate as the recycling rate increased. This would keep
the installed base tracking the IEA planning target.

I don't really have any idea how much PV recycling is being done at present. I see media report of small or very small
projects. So my guess at 10 GW per year would amount to about 30 million panels a year. 

## Flaws and conservative underestimates 

The initial setting of 70,000 tonnes of mined materials per GW or 
PV panels is based on reading a stack of specification sheets. Panels used in solar farms are typically heavier than
those used on rooftops. Over time, weight of panels has declined per MW. Has this been at the expense of durability? Given that solar farms use heavier panels, the answer would appear to be yes.  

No account is made of the aluminium, steel and possibly concrete used for
mounting panels, either on rooftops or in utility scale farms.  **The weight of mounting 
materials often exceeds that of the panels themselves.** 

For utility scale farms, the soil and weather will determine if concrete
footings are required; the tendency seems, for obvious reasons, to try
and avoid that expense. Is mounting material to be considered as waste? I'd say anything
left in a field or which you have to collect for dumping or recycling is waste; until it is actually recycled.

A 2019 [study](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/7/1213) showed that PV panel reliability isn't the weak
link in PV systems. There are many parts of a solar system that can fail. This study found that the average 
time to failure of panels was over 40 years, but the time to failure of inverters was just 8.3 years. Put a 
collection of unreliable elements together and the average time to failure of the system as a whole declines
still further. What happens when a PV system fails? There are three basic possibilities:

1. Nothing 
1. Repair 
1. Upgrade 
1. Replace 

If the owner does nothing, then the system is part of the waste stream, but may simply be left doing
nothing on a roof or in a field. It may be that the company that sold it has disappeared and new companies may
recommend replacement because they don't want to repair old systems where the supply of parts is complex or
impossible. Perhaps a salesperson will suspect they can persuade the owner into an upgrade to a new
more efficient system. 

In many cases, early system failure and marketing activities will make a mockery of failure models.

### Guide to the graph 

All the bars on the chart are in gigawatts (GW). The calculated tonnage of waste below the graph is just estimated
by multiplying the GW by the tonnage per factor figure in the slider.

The bars are as follows:

1. cumFailed ... these are panels which have failed but haven't been recycled because of a lack of capacity 
1. cumInstalled ... total GW included failed panels  
1. operational ... cuminstalled - cumfailed + recycled
1. produced ... new production from freshly mined materials 
1. recycled ... production from recycled material; assumed to be perfect
