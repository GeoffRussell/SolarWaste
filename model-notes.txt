## Model assumptions 

The graph above, with its initial slider settings, 
models the global rollout of solar PV panels according to the IEA Net Zero by 2050.
This IEA plan proposes some 18,750 GW of solar PV ([as updated in 2023](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/9a698da4-4002-4e53-8ef3-631d8971bf84/NetZeroRoadmap_AGlobalPathwaytoKeepthe1.5CGoalinReach-2023Update.pdf)).
As you can see, the model illustrated in the graph above, yields an operational level of 17,440 GW by 2050. The 
small difference may be down to some minor variations in the PV panel failure model I've used, or the
initial conditions; the number of GW of solar rolled out between 2012 and 2022. 
I use the World Energy Statistics data for historical PV capacity; which may not be what the 
IEA use.

The initial settings mirror the assumptions in the IEA netzero by 2050 plan
and envisage compound annual growth rates (CAGR) of 23% out to 2030 and 11% between 2030 and
2050. These two numbers determine the growth in panel production. 

The IEA don't discuss PV module failure in the NZ2050 report, unless I missed it. But one is implied by
their numbers. Those CAGRs without any panel failure would result in a much bigger 
installed gigawatt (GW) base by 2050.

**PV panel failure**

The failure model merely takes panels out of the installed base according to a fairly standard industrial
model based on the mean time to failure of panels (ie. average panel lifespan).

The initial value of this lifespan parameter is 30 years. 

The timing of panel failure is determined by the PV panel failure slider. The IRENA [2016 report](https://www.irena.org/publications/2016/Jun/End-of-life-management-Solar-Photovoltaic-Panels) 
on PV end-of-life management considered two scenarios, *Early loss* (corresponding to value 2.4 on the slider) and
*Regular loss* (corresponding to 5.4 on the slider). These numbers change the timing of waste generation, but not the
long term amount; all panels end up as waste. The early loss scenario corresponds to many panels failing quickly with the rate
of failure than slowing substantially. Our initial value of 1 sees many panels fail quickly but the rate then slows substantially
with many panels having a long life. 

The IRENA report looks to be simply wrong in its estimate of waste. Without access to the program code, this is hard to
prove, but there is evidnce in the program itself. The following chart compares the IRENA waste estimates for Japan with that 
of a Japanese report. The Japanese waste estimates have the familiar exponential shape you'd expect to see as failures
rise quickly in an aging and growing panel population. The IRENA figures look linear ... which makes no sense
at all. The [program code for my model](https://github.com/GeoffRussell/SolarWaste) is available on GitHub. Feel free to download
and test it. If you find a mistake, then by all means let me know and I'll fix it.

**PV recycling**

Recycling is modelled by magic whereby failed panels are simply added back to the
operational base until the recycling capacity for the year is reached. We allow the recycling capacity and its growth
rate to be changed; like all the other model parameters.

A more realistic model would dial back the production growth rate as the recycling rate increased. This would keep
the installed base tracking the IEA planning target.

I don't really have any idea how much PV recycling is being done at present. I see media report of small or very small
projects. So my guess at 10 GW per year would amount to about 30 million panels a year. 

**Panel weight and waste**

The initial setting of 70,000 tonnes of mined materials per GW or 
PV panels is based on reading a stack of specification sheets. Panels used in solar farms are typically heavier than
those used on rooftops.

No account is made of the aluminium, steel and possibly concrete
used for mounting panels, either on rooftops or in utility scale farms. The weight of mounting materials often exceeds that of
the panels themselves. For utility scale farms, the soil and weather will determine if concrete footings are 
required; the tendency seems, for obvious reasons, to try and avoid that expense.

### Guide to the graph 

All the bars on the chart are in gigawatts (GW). The calculated tonnage of waste below the graph is just estimated
by multiplying the GW by the tonnage per factor figure in the slider.

The bars are as follows:

1. cumFailed ... these are panels which have failed but haven't been recycled because of a lack of capacity 
1. cumInstalled ... total GW included failed panels  
1. operational ... cuminstalled - cumfailed + recycled
1. produced ... new production from freshly mined materials 
1. recycled ... production from recycled material; assumed to be perfect
